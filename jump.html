<div id="description">
The year is 2018. It is summer, and a massive heatwave has struck
the city of Vancouver. It hasn't rained in over a month, and half
of the reservoirs' water supply has already been depleted. All
across the city, precious H20 is being wasted daily. Water sprinklers
being left on constantly, faucets left on and forgotten,
and cars being washed more frequently than necessary. These are just 
a few examples of the many ways that water is being mistreated every
day.

To combat this blatant disregard for H20-kind, and in hopes of saving
the city from certain disaster, an automated aquatic advocate named
"H-2NO" has been created and sent to the parts of the city where the
water wasting activity is most dense. H-2NO is a master of turning off
taps and faucets; however, it has one fatal flaw: It is highly
susceptible to water. Even the tiniest drop of water making contact
with its outer shell will cause it to short circuit and shut down.

Guide H-2NO through water-rampant residential neighbourhoods and across 
sprinkler-infested lawns to the main sources of water waste, while putting
an end to all unnecessary water usage along the way.
