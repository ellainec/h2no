				<p>For the past few days we've been working on implementing much of the functionality into the game itself using Phaser and the database itself <br> <br> (HUGE THANKS to Ellaine Chan: our database specialist) <br> <br> The learning curve for Phaser was quite steep as we knew nearly nothing about it and spent a lot of time learning to manage states and files to increase workflow capabilities. We managed to pick up what we could from the resources we had online. We've been less focused on graphics and increasingly focused on gameplay elements and dificulty, such as enemies and NPC functionality. Originally we had intended to market the game towards a younger audience, but as time went on, we got new ideas and wanted to build a more complex storyline. <br> <br> The game is still intended to be used by kids around ages 7+ so that they can gain a better understanding of water waste, but it is likely that older people will still be able to play this game and have just as much fun, as we've come up with a unique storyline!<br> <br> Anyways, time to get back to work! </p>

				<p>After doing more research we may likely decide with the deadlines coming up that it isn't completely feasible to make a game that we would be proud of with Vanilla Javascript. We are doing more research with JS libraries and frameworks, such as PIXI.js and Phaser. These tools will help us to create a much more interesting storyline and gameplay, as doing so with Vanilla Javascript doesn't seem feasible with the amount of current experience we have right now. After 4 months of learning, and a deadline of needing to have a large amount of it done by the coming week it seems less than likely we'll be able to complete it in time if we attempt to use Vanilla Javascript. <br> <br> As much as I would love to learn more and create this using Vanilla Javascript... We have deadlines... <br> <br> Hope to update again soon!

				<p><img id="WaterBot" src="../assets/characters/WaterBotGif.gif" alt="WaterBotGif"> We decided on a robot character as a main character! It's name was originally going to be WaterBot, but one of the members came up with an interesting parellel with Star Wars. C3-PO is a robot is well! So we decided, let's use C3-PO as inspiration! Thus, the name H2-NO became our offical game name.</p>

				<p>The team finally managed to settle on an idea of how we wanted to implement this. We've agreed that we wanted to create an educational game for kids around 5-10. Why? It's easier to brainwash kids than adults. Hehe. See what I did there? Brain-'Wash' <br> - okay jokes aside - <br> We decided to make something similar to Mario. Though we kept bouncing ideas back and forth it was a relief to have finally settled on an idea. We'll be doing research to gather information on how we would implement this to work on both desktop and mobile. <br> <br>  To be honest though, it is quite easy to lose focus and forget that one should be designing for mobile first before designing for desktop. <br> <br> I'm hoping to have implemented some interesting features by next week. We've mostly been thinking about using Javascript and HTML5 Canvas.
