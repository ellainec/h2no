        A time not too distant in the future, the era of the Great Disaster, where humans had 
		completely wasted the limited fresh water resource they had been gifted on earth. 
		A young scientist going by the name of Marina, built a robot named H2-NO. 
		She had managed to build a time travel machine. and wanting to stop the 
		Era of the Great Disaster from occuring, Marina sent H2-NO back in time 
		to save the future of the world, by attempting to build up awareness
		in the children of Vancouver about water waste! Your job is to help H2-NO turn off the 
		major water wasting appliances around the city of Vancouver!
