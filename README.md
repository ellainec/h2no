h2no is a fun side-scroller game that aims to educate players about water conservation. The player is controlling a robot, named h2no, 
through the city of Vancouver to turn off sprinklers before the time runs and and avoid getting wet.

The game detects if the user is on mobile or desktop and will start the player on the appropriate game state. 

For desktop users, they will be playing a fuller version with 3 variation of sprinklers. The control keys are the arrow keys. 

For mobile users, they will be playing on a nearly identical game except with 2 variation of sprinklers for performance management. The controls
are a joystick and a jump buttom in the game.
